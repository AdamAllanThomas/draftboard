# DraftBattles

## What is this?

My girlfriend and I like to do a game when we are bored where we do a draft of items from a specific topic. We take turns picking things related to the topic, and whoever has a better team at the end, wins. It's fun to come up with creative picks, and have a friendly debate about who's picks are better.

Generally, we would just play without any way to keep track of our picks, so I thought it would be cool to try to make this.

## Why?

Cause I want to learn how to do stuff.
